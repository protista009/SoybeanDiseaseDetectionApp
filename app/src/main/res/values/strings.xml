        <!-- Descriptions -->
        <string name="desc_sudden_death">Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS) is a fungal disease in soybeans that causes yellowing, browning, and death of leaf tissues. It appears mid- to late-season and can severely reduce yield.</string>
        <string name="desc_southern_blight">A soil-borne fungal disease causing leaf yellowing, wilting, and white fungal growth at the base of the stem.</string>
        <string name="desc_septoria">Septoria brown spot causes small, dark brown lesions on lower leaves, which may lead to premature defoliation in wet, warm conditions.</string>
        <string name="desc_brown_spot">A common fungal disease that leads to small reddish-brown spots on leaves, starting from the lower canopy and moving upward.</string>
        <string name="desc_bacterial_blight">Caused by Pseudomonas syringae, it creates water-soaked spots that turn brown and may cause leaf tearing under high humidity.</string>
        <string name="desc_ferrugen">This disease shows circular gray spots with reddish borders on leaves and can reduce yield significantly in humid environments.</string>
        <string name="desc_yellow_mosaic">A viral disease spread by whiteflies; it causes yellow patches and mosaic-like patterns on leaves, leading to stunted plant growth.</string>
        <string name="desc_mosaic_virus">A general term for several viruses that cause mottled green and yellow patterns on leaves, often reducing vigor and yield.</string>
        <string name="desc_powdery_mildew">Characterized by white, powdery fungal growth on the surface of leaves; typically appears in dry, warm weather.</string>
